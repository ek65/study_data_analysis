        "Prepare a bowl in front of you at about chest height.",
        "Position the bowl a little bit more on the right side.",
        "Take the lighter weight object, the cube.",
        "Pick up the cube and try to lift it as much as you can.",
        "Bend your arm as much as the brace will allow as you move the cube.",
        "Move the cube to your right.",
        "Place the cube on the side of the table and gently let it go.",
        "Lower your hand and pick up the banana.",
        "Lift your arm to bring the banana up towards your face, bending your elbow as much as the brace will allow.",
        "If the object is too heavy, move your arm out horizontally instead of lifting the banana high.",
        "Place the banana gently on the table.",
        "Grab the last cube in the bowl and try to lift it a little bit higher if possible.",
        "Move the cube to your side and then gently set it down."
