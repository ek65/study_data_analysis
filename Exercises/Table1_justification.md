### **Procedural Variation**
**(Count: 15)** This feature identifies instructions where the core sequence, quality of movement, or therapeutic goal is substantially different from the template.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex1 (Instruction 2)** 
    * **Justification:** Deviates from the templateâ€™s 2D reaching task by introducing a different 3D functional goal of moving cubes to specific locations.
    > 8. Move the green cube to the pink post-it note.
    > 9. Move the blue cube to the blue post-it note.
    > 10. Move the orange cube to the yellow post-it note.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex1 (Instruction 4)** 
    * **Justification:** Introduces a completely different procedure of lining up cubes and then moving them to the edge of the table.
    > 1. Line up all three cubes on Yuri's left side using the right hand.
    > 3. Bring the orange cube to the edge of the table on the right side.
    > 7. Place the green cube under the blue cube, at the edge of the table of the right side.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex2 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** The procedure is entirely different, changing the goal from a horizontal reach to a vertical lift against gravity using weighted objects.
    > 2. Lift the green cube up to your shoulder by bending your right elbow.
    > 3. Lower the green cube back down by straightening your elbow as much as you can.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex3 (Instruction 1)**
    * **Justification:** The repetition structure is different from the template, including explicit "break" and "repeat" steps. It also adds a safety contingency.
    > 5. Repeat the rotation with the scoop once more, going palm down then palm up.
    > 6. Take a break until you can begin again .
    > 7. Repeat the exercise 1 more time.
    > Stop if there is any pain.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex3 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** Adds a new instruction to lift the hand
    > 6. Lift your hand from the table, while stabilizing your elbow on the table.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex3 (Instruction 4)** 
    * **Justification:** Modifies the procedure by adding an isometric hold, a different therapeutic element.
    > 5. Hold each position for 3 seconds.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex5 (Instruction 2)**
    * **Justification:** The procedure is modified with a conditional rule for progression.
    > Note: If the exercise is not challenging enough, additional resistance such as finger web or rubber band may be used to make it harder.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex5 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** The sequence is different. The template instructs individualized finger movements, while this instruction prescribes global finger adduction/abduction.
    > 3. Bring all your fingers together so that there's no space in between your fingers.
    > 4. Spread your fingers out all the way.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex6 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** Deviates from the template by introducing cubes and a different movement pattern focused on lifting against gravity.
    > 3. Bring all your fingers together so that there's no space in between your fingers.
    > 4. Spread your fingers out all the way.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex7 (Instruction 1)** 
    * **Justification:** The entire procedure is different, focusing on individual grasp-and-release cycles with adaptive strategies, unlike the template's simple sequence.
    > 3. Take the lighter weight object, the cube.
    > 4. Pick up the cube and try to lift it as much as you can.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex7 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** The procedure is fundamentally altered by adding a preparatory motor priming phase before the main task, and also specifies how to exactly pick up the spoon which was not specified in the original template instruction.
    > 1. Perform opposition (touch the pads of your thumb and index finger) between your thumb and index finger.
    > 5. Use your thumb and index finger to pick up the handle of the spoon.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex8 (Instruction 2)** 
    * **Justification:** The sequence is modified by adding post-task practice steps.
    > 10. "Practice picking up the coin from the table and then putting it down."
    > 12. "Practice the action of putting the coin back in the wallet, using this as a gripping exercise with your fingers."

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex8 (Instruction 4)** 
    * **Justification:** Adds a novel functional step (stacking) not present in the template.
    > 6. Stack this coin on top of the other coin.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex9 (Instruction 4)** 
    * **Justification:** The procedure is entirely different, involving a different stacking order and adding complex movements like crossing the body.
    > 6. Stack the green cube on top of the blue cube.
    > 7. Cross your body with your right arm towards the orange cube.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex10 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** The procedure is modified by adding a second phase where the items are transferred back to their starting point.
    > 6. after all balls are transferred to the towel, transfer them back to the bowl one at a time

### **Equipment Modification**
**(Count: 6)** This feature identifies instructions that use different or additional physical objects compared to the template.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex1 (Instruction 2)** 
    * **Justification:** Uses "cubes" in addition to the template's post-it notes.
    > 8. Move the green cube to the pink post-it note.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex1 (Instruction 4)** 
    * **Justification:** Uses "cubes" instead of the template's post-it notes.
    > 1. Line up all three cubes...

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex2 (Instruction 3)** 
    * **Justification:** Uses "cubes" instead of the template's post-it notes.
    > 1. Grab the green cube with your right hand.

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex5 (Instruction 2)** 
    * **Justification:** Suggests using a "finger web or rubber band," which are not in the template.
    > Note: ...additional resistance such as finger web or rubber band may be used...

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex6 (Instruction 3)**
    * **Justification:** Uses "cubes" in addition to the template's fruits. 
    > 3. "Take the lighter weight object, the cube."

* [cite_start]**Source: Ex7 (Instruction 1)** 
    * **Justification:** Substitutes the template's spoon and chopsticks with a "scoop" and "tongs."
